      <h2>Why I’m In This Class</h2>
      <p>
        Hello to anyone that may end up on this page! My name is Esom
        Too-Chiobi (Eh-so-m Toe-Chee-Oh-Bee) and I am a Master's student
        studying Computer Engineering at Texas A&M. I decided to enroll in
        this class for two main reasons:
        <ol>
          <li> 
            I have an interest in media technologies and how they affect society. 
            I saw taking this course as a great opportunity to explore these topics in depth. 
          </li>            
          <li>
            I wanted to take a computer science course that focuses more on the applications of technologies
            rather than just the theorectical or technical aspects.
          </li>
        </ol>
        I'm hoping that by the end of this course, I have a deeper understanding on how technologies have shaped media consumption and production, 
        as well as the implication of these changes on society.

      <h2>A Challenge I Experience</h2>

      <p>
        One challenge I experience with media consumption is how short-form content,
        while easy and engaging to consume, has begun to shape my expectations for how
        quickly information and stories should be delivered.
      </p>

      <p>
        Short-form platforms are designed to communicate ideas within seconds,
        and this can lead me the idea that understanding should happen almost immediately.
        Over time, this has contributed to my growing impatience when engaging with
        longer-form media or tools that require prolonged attention and exploration.
      </p>

      <p>
        I notice this most when working with unfamiliar creator tools or software.
        If I do not understand how something works right away, I am more likely to feel
        frustrated and disengage rather than slow down and experiment with the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        While I am aware of this challenge, managing it is still an ongoing process.
        I try to consistently remind myself to approach new media and tools with 
        patience and curiosity rather than expecting instant results.
